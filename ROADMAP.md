# Chop It Up — ROADMAP
<!-- roadmap-schema: whitelist-v3 -->

## Definition
Local Windows hub where Yovan, Claude (Claude Desktop) and GPT (Codex UI inside the ChatGPT desktop app) chat in shared rooms over MCP, each on its own subscription — no API keys, no consumer-UI automation, loopback-only. Repo: github.com/yovanmc/ChopItUp (public since 2026-09-04).

## Milestones
| # | Title | Status | Ready | Plan | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 26 | Probe: does a running Claude Code session read an exported memory directory | ✅ | DONE | — | Answer YES, measured 2026-09-17 with `tools/Invoke-Row26MemoryProbe.ps1` (22 PASS / 0 FAIL, 3 Sonnet calls, leg 4 not needed): leg 1 saw the `user`, `room-general` and last-index-line nonces (no `metadata.type` filter, all 198 entries visible); leg 2 saw entry 198 but not the hand-appended 199th index line (the 200-line cap holds, no error reported); leg 3 read the `room-general` topic file body on demand with `Read`. Blocked one day on the standalone CLI being signed out; detail in `docs/verification.md` "Probe: does a session read the export?". |
| 6 | Town view: walkable characters per participant (Octopath-style) | [ ] | DEFERRED: long-term vision, owner ruling 2026-09-04 | — | Renderer and art were deferred with the milestone: working assumptions were Phaser 3 in-page and CC0 placeholder art with simple avatars. Neither is decided — re-open both when this row starts. |
| 7 | ChatGPT chat-tab read-only connector via tunnel | [ ] | DEFERRED: Plus-plan gating unverified; owner ruled tunnels out of v1 | — | help.openai.com 2026-09-04: write actions Business/Enterprise only; Pro read-only; Plus unlisted. |
