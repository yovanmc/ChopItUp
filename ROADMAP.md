# Chop It Up — ROADMAP
<!-- roadmap-schema: whitelist-v3 -->

## Definition
Local Windows hub where Yovan, Claude (Claude Desktop) and GPT (Codex UI inside the ChatGPT desktop app) chat in shared rooms over MCP, each on its own subscription — no API keys, no consumer-UI automation, loopback-only. Repo: github.com/yovanmc/ChopItUp (public since 2026-09-04).

## Milestones
| # | Title | Status | Ready | Plan | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 27 | A cap-driven park tells the owner they stopped it | ✅ | DONE | — | Merged `ff6aa43` (PR #70); deployed 09-09, self-check 27/27. **Rollback: `C:\Self Apps\ChopItUp.backup-20260909-225323`**. The stop cause is passed, never inferred: `ExchangeStopCause` rides `RunDecision.End` and the snapshot, so the note and the bar name the run. .NET 867 → 873; client 51 → 54. |
| 28 | A spawn can act as the owner | [ ] | READY | — | Directory/run spawns get Bash; every `/api` route but `/mcp` and the two skill-decision POSTs is unauthenticated, so a spawn can POST a message stamped `owner` with no credential. `data	okens.json` also holds every token in the clear [V 2026-09-09 7ef0461]. An owner post starts runs. ACL/DPAPI are dead ends (same user). Replaces row 13. |
| 26 | Owner probe: does a running Claude Code session actually read an exported memory directory | [ ] | OWNER: point `autoMemoryDirectory` at an exported scratch dir in a throwaway project, start a session, ask it — fixture per `docs/verification.md` "Owner probe" | — | Carried out of row 24 (`f964ece`, PR #63) when that row closed. Physically owner-only; not a merge gate. |
| 12 | Desktop shell: WebView2 window that starts the hub, hosts the room UI, sits in the tray | [ ] | BACKLOG | — | Grill D18. After the autonomy rows. |
| 14 | Roles per participant and per-room personas | [ ] | BACKLOG | — | Grill D2/D4 v1.1. |
| 17 | Spawner test `A5_a_participant_is_never_in_flight_twice_in_one_room` flakes on slow runners | [ ] | LEAD: cause unverified; existence [V 2026-09-06 930be773] CI fail on docs-only PR #31 (run 34013942998) plus one local one-off | — | Pending mark not published within the 500 ms quiet window; inferred: timing, not logic. Reproduce under load, then fix the wait or the publish path. |
| 6 | Town view: walkable characters per participant (Octopath-style) | [ ] | DEFERRED: long-term vision, owner ruling 2026-09-04 | — | Renderer and art were deferred with the milestone: working assumptions were Phaser 3 in-page and CC0 placeholder art with simple avatars. Neither is decided — re-open both when this row starts. |
| 7 | ChatGPT chat-tab read-only connector via tunnel | [ ] | DEFERRED: Plus-plan gating unverified; owner ruled tunnels out of v1 | — | help.openai.com 2026-09-04: write actions Business/Enterprise only; Pro read-only; Plus unlisted. |
