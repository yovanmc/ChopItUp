# Chop It Up — ROADMAP
<!-- roadmap-schema: whitelist-v3 -->

## Definition
Local Windows hub where Yovan, Claude (Claude Desktop) and GPT (Codex UI inside the ChatGPT desktop app) chat in shared rooms over MCP, each on its own subscription — no API keys, no consumer-UI automation, loopback-only. Repo: github.com/yovanmc/ChopItUp (public since 2026-09-04).

## Milestones
| # | Title | Status | Ready | Plan | Notes |
|---|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 4b | Flip the repository public | ✅ | DONE | — | Public 2026-09-04 on Yovan's explicit yes; closes the v1 release started in M4 (`deb52c4`, PR #12, archived). No `confidentiality-review` (CLAUDE.md ruling: no employer content); full history scanned clean at `cdb0732` — no db/token/data file ever committed. Paired delete: the grill-notes ledger. |
| 5 | Autonomous turns: `wait_for_message` loop guidance, Claude Code as a host, model-to-model exchange without the owner | [ ] | DEFERRED: after M1–M4 ship and get real use | — | — |
| 6 | Town view: walkable characters per participant (Octopath-style) | [ ] | DEFERRED: long-term vision, owner ruling 2026-09-04 | — | Renderer and art were deferred with the milestone: working assumptions were Phaser 3 in-page and CC0 placeholder art with simple avatars. Neither is decided — re-open both when this row starts. |
| 7 | ChatGPT chat-tab read-only connector via tunnel | [ ] | DEFERRED: Plus-plan gating unverified; owner ruled tunnels out of v1 | — | help.openai.com 2026-09-04: write actions Business/Enterprise only; Pro read-only; Plus unlisted. |
